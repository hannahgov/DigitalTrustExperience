What is the Access Experience Pattern?
======================================

The Access experience pattern leverages digital credentials to simplify and secure the way users access digital services. By utilizing verifiable credentials stored in a digital wallet, users can seamlessly prove their identity or attributes without relying on traditional usernames and passwords. This approach enhances user convenience and strengthens security across various digital interactions.

Why use digital credentials to access digital services?
=======================================================

**Problem:** Traditional access methods, such as usernames and passwords, present significant security vulnerabilities and are often cumbersome for users. These methods are prone to data breaches, phishing attacks, and require extensive management for password recovery and updates.

**Benefits:** Digital credentials address these issues by providing a more secure and user-friendly authentication method. They offer cryptographic assurance, reducing the risk of data breaches and identity theft. Additionally, digital credentials streamline the access process, improving the overall user experience and aligning with best practices in digital identity management.

How it works?
=============

Digital Trust Access enables users to securely and seamlessly access digital services using verifiable digital credentials. The process involves three key steps: Verify, Authenticate, and Access.

**Verify:**

When a user wants to access a service, they present their digital credential through the BC Wallet. The service (Verifier) checks the credential to ensure it meets the required criteria.

**Authenticate:**

The user confirms their identity via the BC Wallet. The Verifier uses the verifiable data registry to validate the credential, confirming its authenticity with the Issuer.

**Access:**

Once authenticated, the user gains access to the digital service. The Verifier grants access based on the successful authentication.
